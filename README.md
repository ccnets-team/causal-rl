# Overview

## **Introduction**

RL-Tune is a customizable Reinforcement Learning framework designed to offer flexibility, modularity, and adaptability to various RL scenarios. Below are detailed descriptions of the key features of the framework to help users leverage its full potential.

## **Key Points**

1. Tune RL Parameters for benchmarking, with a preset pipeline ready to execute reducing your effort in initial setups.
2. Develop flexible custom algorithms based on RL principles using role-based network, uniformly integrated with the latest RL frameworks.
3. Introduction of Causal RL integrating reverse-environment network into Actor-Critic framework learning the causal relationships between states, actions, and values, while maximizing accumulative rewards.

# Features

**1. Manageable RL Parameters**

RL-Tune facilitates structured management of RL Parameters, allowing users to easily organize, store, and compare parameters, which provides more coherent configurations for diverse RL problems.

```python
from utils.setting.env_settings import analyze_env

env_config, rl_params = analyze_env(env_name = "HumanoidStandup-v4")

rl_params.algorithm.num_td_steps = 5
rl_params.normalization.state_normalizer = "running_z_standardizer"
```

**2. Comprehensive RL Modules**

RL-Tune features comprehensive modules including memory, normalization, noise, exploration, and strategy managers, enabling a cohesive and seamless problem-solving experience in the RL domain.

**3. Flexible Network Role Assignments:**

RL-Tuneâ€™s flexible architecture facilitates distinct role assignments to different networks, optimizing the processes of development and management for various network configurations.

```python
from nn.roles.actor_network import SingleInputActor as QNetwork
from nn.roles.critic_network import SingleInputCritic
from nn.roles.reverse_env_network import RevEnv

q_network = QNetwork(network, env_config, network_params, exploration_params)
critic = SingleInputCritic(network, env_config, network_params)
reverse_env = RevEnv(network, env_config, network_params)

```

**4. Custom Algorithm Formulation with BaseTrainer Class:**

RL-Tune is built around the BaseTrainer class, empowering users to formulate custom algorithms and utilize commonalized functions for crafting powerful and efficient RL solutions.

```python
class BaseTrainer:
    def compute_values(self, states: torch.Tensor, rewards: torch.Tensor,
                       next_states: torch.Tensor, dones: torch.Tensor,
                       estimated_value: torch.Tensor) -> (torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor):
		...

class YourRLTrainer(BaseTrainer):
```

**5. Enhanced Algorithmic Components:**
