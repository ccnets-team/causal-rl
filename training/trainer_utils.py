    """
    Creates a padding mask for a trajectory by sampling from the end of the sequence. The mask is set to 0 
    (masked) for elements occurring before the 'done' signal when viewed from the end of the trajectory. 
    This includes padding elements that are positioned on the left side of the first 'done' signal in the 
    reversed sequence. The elements from the 'done' signal to the end of the trajectory (rightmost end) 
    are unmasked (set to 1).

    This function is useful for trajectories where sampling starts from the end and padding occurs before 
    the 'done' signal in the reversed order.

    Args:
    - dones (torch.Tensor): The tensor representing the 'done' signals in the trajectory.

    Returns:
    - mask (torch.Tensor): The resultant padding mask tensor. In this mask, elements occurring before the 
      'done' signal in the reversed sequence are masked (set to 0), while the elements from the 'done' 
      signal to the end of the trajectory are unmasked (set to 1).
